The lowest or average package is about 6 to 7 LPA per student, according to their branches. Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Walmart, and Accenture recruit from here. There are also several canteens with specialized themes like food, sports, etc. There is also a gaming area where you can play and watch games. There is also a tea spot where many students come in the evening to drink tea with friends and talk about their classes. The faculty is great and helps students as soon as possible. They teach great things about theoretical and practical knowledge. The curriculum here is provided by AKTU University. Semester exams are pretty average, so even if you are not so good at studies, you just need to practice questions. Overall, college life is very good; you won't regret your time at this college. There are many clubs and groups to join and participate in many fests, so GL Bajaj is good for your future, trust me."

The average package is about 7 to 8 LPA and for other branches, it is about 5 to 6 LPA and the lowest package is 3 LPA. About 30 to 40% of students got internships. The college has a canteen, a fully AC library, and all the other sports grounds and courts are also there. The college has a workshop lab, graphic lab and computer labs. All classes are good but there is one problem the B.Tech classrooms are non-AC. This creates problems in studies in summer especially in May and June. So, I have one recommendation for the college to install AC in the classroom. All the teachers are well qualified and their teaching style is also better. All the teachers are very supportive they also support in tackling real-life problems. Overall, the teaching quality is the best. The semester exams are difficult to moderate level. The best thing about the course is that it has better placement than other courses. The college hosts only one main event annually. The campus size is not much bigger but is sufficient enough. Scholarships are provided by the UP government for financially weak students."

Infosys and Bosch are the top recruiting companies for our course. As I am in my 2nd year, there is no internship provided for us, but as the seniors talked, they said that in my 3rd year. Internships should be compulsory for all. Jio Wi-Fi is available for all students but only 1 GB per day. There are two libraries on the college campus for B.Tech. students. Classrooms are well organized, but there is no AC in classes, which is very bad in the summer. Teachers were very helpful, always ready to help the students. All faculty members are qualified and supportive. The Aktu syllabus is followed in the college. No, semester exams are not very difficult for us because college can prepare us very strictly for semester exams by the sessional exams 1, 2, and pre-test. In today's era, the electronics branch is too popular and there is scope in this branch. So take electronics and communication engineering. They should improve the lab systems. I am dissatisfied with the events at the college. Only freshers are held in terms of events."

Most of the placement companies visiting are offering around 4-6 LPA, while placements for sales roles are going much higher, with 10 LPA being offered.

                " 3. Prioritize Questions: As you go through the test, prioritize questions based on your confidence level. Start with questions you find easier and can answer quickly. Mark more difficult questions for review. \n" +
                " 4. Use the On-Screen Timer: Keep an eye on the timer displayed on the computer screen. This will help you gauge your progress and ensure you don't spend too much time on a single question or section. \n" +
                " 5. Practice Time Management: Take practice tests in a timed environment to hone your time management skills. Simulate test conditions as closely as possible during your practice sessions. \n" +
                " 6. Avoid Getting Stuck: If you encounter a particularly challenging question, don't dwell on it for too long. Mark it for review and move on. You can revisit it later if time permits. \n" +
                " 7. Review Marked Questions: Towards the end of the test, return to the questions you marked for review. Use any remaining time to carefully reconsider your answers and make any necessary changes. \n" +
                " 8. Don't Rush: While time management is essential, avoid rushing through the test. Read questions and answer choices carefully to minimize errors. \n" +
                " 9. Skip Questions Strategically: If you're unsure about a question, make an educated guess and move on. Don't leave any questions unanswered, as there is typically no penalty for guessing. \n" +
                " 10. Stay Calm and Composed: Test anxiety can affect time management. Take deep breaths and stay focused. Panicking can lead to poor time allocation. \n" +
                " 11. Pace Yourself Consistently: Maintain a consistent pace throughout the test. Avoid spending too much time on the initial questions, leaving insufficient time for later sections. \n" +
                " 12. Practice Efficient Navigation: Familiarize yourself with the test navigation tools, such as moving forward and backward between questions. Efficient navigation can save time. \n" +

This suggests that JIMS may enjoy a stronger reputation according to student feedback. Additionally, JIMS Greater Noida offers a variety of programs in engineering, business administration, computer applications, and other fields, which are recognized and accredited by relevant regulatory authorities such as AICTE, BCI, and NCTE. It has been consistently ranked highly in certain categories, particularly in BBA and BCA, by several ranking organizations. Furthermore, JIMS Greater Noida boasts strong industry partnerships and high placement rates, with an average annual package of approximately INR 4.74 lakh and a highest CTC of INR 17 lakh per annum. In contrast, while there isn't detailed comparative data available regarding IILM University, Greater Noida, it should be noted that Dr. Gunjan Mittal, who previously taught at JIMS, now holds a position at IILM University, indicating some level of professional respect for both institutions. Ultimately, prospective students would benefit most from visiting each campus, speaking with faculty and current students, and considering their individual needs when making a decision."

Companies like TCS, INFOSYS, BYJUS, etc., recruit placements from our college. Internship basically depends from person to person, as per their interest and dedication towards the subject. Contact with seniors and faculty members is helpful as the faculty is really good.\n\nInfrastructure: The infrastructure of the college is really nice. Air-conditioned classrooms and classes have projectors as well. Chairs and tables in the class as well as in the canteen are comfortable. The library of the college is well-equipped with computer systems and provides a wide variety of books. The campus is equipped with Wi-Fi. A new computer lab is made in the college with well-equipped the latest systems in it. The systems have all the software and compilers installed for the coders like- Visual Studio Code 2022, Turbo, etc. An open amphitheater is there for the students where we can have group discussions.\n\nFaculty: The college provides with knowledgeable faculty. Classes are conducted properly, and the teachers teach with interest. Doubt sessions with the teachers can be held in person during the break schedule. The college is GSSIPU affiliated, so the same curriculum is followed in our college. Teachers complete the course on time, and mid-sem question papers are from the university only. The mid-sem checking is done internally and is done in a way to prepare the students for the end-sem exams. The difficulty of semester exams depends on the student.\n\nOther: The course provides knowledge in various fields like mechanics, workshop, Physics, mathematics, etc. Communication Skills is the most important subject as it teaches students how to communicate during interviews. Events like hackathons, blind coding, mastermind, treasure hunts, and navras are conducted, bringing a diverse range of activities from various fields. Campus surroundings are also good. The campus is in the knowledge park, which itself is an area filled with knowledge. University fests like Anugoonj and Celebrity Night are also conducted.",

Most students should enroll here for degree purposes, but they can also seek placements from outside. If you're looking for an average placement and package, this college could be an option. I have joined this college solely for degree purposes.\n\nInfrastructure: This college has only one boys hostel on its campus, accommodating around 50 to 100 boys from different departments. On paper, it is mentioned that these hostels offer good 3-time food facilities with Wi-Fi and AC, but I cannot confirm from personal experience as I have never been there.\n\nFaculty: The faculty of this college is supportive and motivating. While I can't speak for all faculty members, in my department, I've found them to possess vast knowledge about their subjects and be genuinely supportive. So, yes, the faculty members in this college are indeed supportive and nice.\n\nOther: No"

I know of my friend's package, which is INR 2 LPA. Airtel and Infosys are top recruiting companies. Software developer, tester, software engineer, web developer, and full stack developer are all roles offered in our course. According to the knowledge students gain after college, they get the job.\n\nInfrastructure: Infrastructure-wise, the college is good and has good hostel facilities with all the services. Wi-Fi, lab, classroom, library—everything is good. One thing I want to highlight here about libraries is that their rules are not good. They say you cannot sit in the library during class time, and the good books are placed in the reference section and we cannot issue them. That is not good.\n\nFaculty: Yes, teachers support and help students perform well. The course curriculum is not relevant and doesn't make the students industry-ready, as there is a lot to learn about it, including its history. In my opinion, course curriculum should be updated every year in order to keep up with technological advances and industry demands.\n\nOther: CSE is a demanding field in today's market. And I also like to study computers. I'd like to see some changes, such as only taking two or three exams per semester instead of five or six. And introduce practical implementations of methods we read about in books. So that students can be student-ready. Events happen here, like the Freshers Welcome Party. Also, scholarships are provided by the government through IP University."

Basically, make sure you understand the rules for the programme you want, meet all the requirements, and do your best in the entrance exams. That's how you'll have the best chance of getting in! Hope it helps. +"

There are also several canteens with specialized themes like food, sports, etc. There is also a gaming area where you can play and watch games. There is also a tea spot where many students come in the evening to drink tea with friends and talk about their classes. The faculty is great and helps students as soon as possible. They teach great things about theoretical and practical knowledge. The curriculum here is provided by AKTU University. Semester exams are pretty average, so even if you are not so good at studies, you just need to practice questions. Overall, college life is very good; you won't regret your time at this college.

The college has a canteen, a fully AC library, and all the other sports grounds and courts are also there. The college has a workshop lab, graphic lab and computer labs. All classes are good but there is one problem the B.Tech classrooms are non-AC. This creates problems in studies in summer especially in May and June. So, I have one recommendation for the college to install AC in the classroom. All the teachers are well qualified and their teaching style is also better. All the teachers are very supportive they also support in tackling real-life problems. Overall, the teaching quality is the best. The semester exams are difficult to moderate level. The best thing about the course is that it has better placement than other courses. The college hosts only one main event annually. The campus size is not much bigger but is sufficient enough. Scholarships are provided by the UP government for financially weak students."

Infosys and Bosch are the top recruiting companies for our course. As I am in my 2nd year, there is no internship provided for us, but as the seniors talked, they said that in my 3rd year. Internships should be compulsory for all. Jio Wi-Fi is available for all students but only 1 GB per day. There are two libraries on the college campus for B.Tech. students. Classrooms are well organized, but there is no AC in classes, which is very bad in the summer. Teachers were very helpful, always ready to help the students. All faculty members are qualified and supportive. The Aktu syllabus is followed in the college. No, semester exams are not very difficult for us because college can prepare us very strictly for semester exams by the sessional exams 1, 2, and pre-test. In today's era, the electronics branch is too popular and there is scope in this branch. So take electronics and communication engineering. They should improve the lab systems. I am dissatisfied with the events at the college. Only freshers are held in terms of events."
